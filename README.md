Project Title : Potato Leaf Disease Detection

Abstract:

Potato leaf disease detection is crucial for food security, as diseases like early and late blight reduce crop yields. Traditional inspection methods are slow, leading to the adoption of automated solutions using deep learning and computer vision. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown high accuracy, such as a hybrid CNN-SVM approach achieving 99% accuracy and pre-trained CNN models reaching 99.01%. However, computational complexity remains a challenge, with tri-CNN architectures achieving 98.46% accuracy but being resource-heavy. Lightweight models like RegNetY-400MF balance efficiency and accuracy for real-time applications. Despite high accuracy in controlled settings, real-world performance drops, highlighting the need for better data augmentation and adaptive architectures. Future research should focus on lightweight models, diverse datasets, and real-world validation.

System Architecture:

  1.Image Acquisition:
   
   The leftmost image shows a camera setup, likely used for capturing plant leaf images.

  2.Preprocessing & Feature Extraction:
	
   The next step involves image processing, possibly using techniques like segmentation or feature extraction

  3.Dataset Preparation:
 
   The Plant Leaf Disease Dataset is used for training the model.

  4.Deep Learning Model:

   A neural network (likely CNN) processes the dataset to classify the images.

  5.Classification Output:
    
   The model predicts whether a leaf is Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight.This design suggests an AI-based disease detection system for plants, which could be useful in precision agriculture to identify plant diseases early and take preventive measures.
